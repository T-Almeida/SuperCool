# SuperCool
A three.js game inspired on [SuperHot](https://superhotgame.com/) made for the VI class on November 2017

It's available online here: https://t-almeida.github.io/SuperCool/

This game was developed on a tight window and with an academic mentality (had something that works xD). So we were only able to implement the following features:

  - Basic game engine with basic physics
  - Game mechanics (inspired on SuperHot)
  - Collisions, majorly based in raycast (at that time I didn't like to use the bounding box system)
  - Custom models
  - Audio clips that we found online
  - Enemy pools for performance
  - Simple GUI

All the third-party code that we used is inside the threejs folder
